Contents

JohnDeng_ps_set1.ipynb — Notebook with all questions and solutions.

README.md — Documentation and summary of the problem set.

Supporting files/folders — Created as part of specific tasks (e.g., simulated GitHub repo, text files, certificates).

Question 1 (30 pts) — Reproducible Research Setup

Task: Simulate a GitHub repository for a published article.

What was done: Created a folder (question-01) containing placeholders for all project files — scripts, data (raw and processed), and figures. The structure follows best practices for project management and reproducibility.

Question 2 (30 pts) — Practicing Git Commands

Task: Work through a sequence of Git operations including staging, committing, branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.

What was done:

Created a text file solutions_for_question_2.txt with favorite books.

Made commits on different branches (main and wish_to).

Introduced and resolved a merge conflict manually.

Documented all Git commands used and described the timeline of changes.

Question 3 (30 pts) — Git Scavenger Hunt

Task: Solve challenges in an external GitHub-based scavenger hunt (Git Scavenger Hunt Repo
).

What was done: Followed the linked repository’s challenges, explored Git history, and documented answers directly in the notebook.

Question 4 (10 pts) — DataCamp Git Training

Task: Complete at least one course from the Git track on DataCamp.

What was done: Finished a Git course and submitted proof of completion (PDF certificate) as part of the repository.
